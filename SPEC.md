Goal: Save a tweet from a webpage via a chrome extension into an obsidian base (https://help.obsidian.md/bases).

I want to have a base to store a bunch of tweets to revisit for new music or other reasons.
I want to save it in obsidian and not in twitter.
I only need to save the links, not the content.
My obsidian vault is in icloud.
I would eventually like to have multiple options when saving so all saved sites can land in various bases in obsidian. Our design should keep this in mind.
I would prefer to implement this only as an extension if possible. You can assume I have the Local REST API community plugin to make obsidian available on my machine.
